This can reduce the blood flow to the organs such as the stomach and intestines, and cause them to become damaged or inflamed. In some cases, this can result in ulcers, which are painful sores in the lining of the digestive tract, or perforation, which is a hole or tear that allows the contents of the digestive tract to leak into the abdominal cavity. Both conditions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention (WebMD 2013a). Another serious complication of cocaine use is the damage it can cause to the kidneys, which are responsible for filtering waste and toxins from the blood. Cocaine can impair the function of the kidneys in various ways, such as causing inflammation, scarring, infection, or blood clots. It can also trigger a condition called rhabdomyolysis, which is the breakdown of muscle tissue that releases a substance called myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can clog the kidneys and lead to acute kidney failure, which is a sudden and severe loss of kidney function that can be fatal (Jaffe and Kimmel 2006; van der Woude 2000; WebMD 2013a).
  
Besides the digestive system and the kidneys, cocaine use can also affect other organs and systems in the body. For example, cocaine can increase the heart rate and blood pressure, which can strain the heart and increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, or cardiac arrest. Cocaine can also damage the blood vessels in the brain and cause bleeding, swelling, or aneurysm. These conditions can result in permanent brain damage or death (WebMD 2013a).

Cocaine use can also have negative effects on the respiratory system, especially when it is smoked or snorted. Smoking cocaine can irritate the lungs and cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or lung infections. Snorting cocaine can damage the nasal passages and cause nosebleeds, loss of smell, sinus problems, or perforation of the nasal septum. In rare cases, cocaine can cause a condition called pulmonary edema, which is the accumulation of fluid in the lungs that can interfere with breathing and oxygen exchange (WebMD 2013a).
  
Another organ that can be harmed by cocaine use is the liver, which is responsible for metabolizing cocaine and other substances. Cocaine can overload the liver and cause inflammation, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Cocaine can also interact with other drugs or alcohol and produce toxic substances that can damage the liver or other organs. For example, when cocaine is combined with alcohol, it forms a substance called cocaethylene, which is more potent and longer-lasting than cocaine alone. Cocaethylene can increase the risk of liver damage, heart problems, or sudden death (WebMD 2013a).

In addition to the physical effects, cocaine use can also have psychological and social effects. Cocaine can alter the mood and behavior of the user, causing euphoria, excitement, confidence, or paranoia. Cocaine can also impair the judgment and decision-making of the user, leading to risky or violent actions. Cocaine can also cause addiction, which is a chronic and relapsing disorder that involves compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking despite the negative consequences. Addiction can interfere with the user's personal, professional, and social life, and cause problems such as isolation, legal troubles, financial difficulties, or family conflicts (WebMD 2013a).
  
Cocaine use can also have adverse effects on the development and health of unborn babies. Cocaine can cross the placenta and affect the fetus in various ways, such as reducing the blood flow and oxygen supply, increasing the heart rate and blood pressure, or altering the brain chemistry. These effects can result in complications such as miscarriage, premature birth, low birth weight, birth defects, or developmental delays. Cocaine use can also increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is the unexplained death of a baby during sleep. Cocaine use can also affect the mother's health and well-being during pregnancy and after delivery (WebMD 2013a).
  
As these paragraphs show, cocaine use can have serious and harmful effects on various organs and systems in the body, as well as on the psychological and social aspects of the user's life. Cocaine use can also affect the health and development of unborn babies. Therefore, it is important to avoid cocaine use and seek help if one is addicted to cocaine. There are various treatment options available for cocaine addiction, such as behavioral therapy, medication, or support groups. These options can help the user overcome the addiction and recover from the damage caused by cocaine use (WebMD 2013a).
