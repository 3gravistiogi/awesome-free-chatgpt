There are a few ways to remove this text from your slideshows. Here are some of them:
 
- **Register your software**: The easiest and most legal way to remove this text is to register your software with a valid license key. You can purchase a license key from the official website of Photopia, the company that acquired Photodex, the original developer of ProShow Producer. Once you have a license key, you can enter it in the software and activate it. This will remove the text from your slideshows and also unlock more features and updates.
- **Use Camtasia 9**: Another way to remove this text is to use another software called Camtasia 9, which is a screen recording and video editing software. You can use Camtasia 9 to record your slideshow as a video and then edit out the text using the crop tool. This method requires some extra steps and skills, but it can work if you don't want to register your software.
- **Import your slideshow to Photopia**: A third way to remove this text is to import your slideshow to Photopia, which is a new software that is compatible with ProShow Producer. Photopia can import your slideshows without the text and allow you to publish them in various formats. You can also edit and enhance your slideshows using Photopia's features. However, Photopia is not free and you will need to subscribe to use it.

These are some of the ways to remove the "Made as an Evaluation of ProShow Producer" text on ProShow Producer. Depending on your preference and budget, you can choose the one that suits you best.
