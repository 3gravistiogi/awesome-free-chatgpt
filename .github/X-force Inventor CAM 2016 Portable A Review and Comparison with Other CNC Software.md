In this section, we will show you how to use X-Force Inventor CAM 2016 Portable to create a simple CNC program for a 2.5D milling operation. We will use a sample part that is included in the software as an example.

1. Launch X-Force Inventor CAM 2016 Portable from your USB drive or cloud storage service. You will see the Autodesk Inventor CAM interface with a ribbon menu, a browser panel, and a graphics window.
2. Click on the Open button on the Quick Access Toolbar and browse to the folder where you extracted the software. Select the file Sample.ipt and click Open. This will load the sample part model in the graphics window.
3. Click on the CAM tab on the ribbon menu and select Setup from the Manage panel. This will open the Setup dialog box where you can define the machining parameters for your part.
4. In the Setup dialog box, select Milling from the Type drop-down list. This will enable the options for milling operations.
5. Under Stock, click on the Stock button and select Relative Size Box from the drop-down list. This will create a rectangular box around your part that represents the raw material.
6. Under Work Coordinate System (WCS), click on the WCS button and select Select Z Axis/Plane & X Axis from the drop-down list. This will allow you to define the orientation of your part relative to the machine axes.
7. In the graphics window, click on a face of your part that is parallel to the Z axis of your machine. This will set the Z axis direction for your part.
8. Next, click on an edge of your part that is parallel to the X axis of your machine. This will set the X axis direction for your part.
9. Under Origin, click on the Origin button and select Model Box Point from the drop-down list. This will allow you to define the origin point of your part relative to the stock box.
10. In the graphics window, click on a corner point of your stock box that you want to use as the origin point. For example, you can click on the lower left front corner of the stock box.
11. Click OK to close the Setup dialog box and save your settings. You will see a coordinate system icon in the graphics window that shows the orientation and origin of your part.
12. Now you are ready to create your machining operations. Click on 2D from the Milling panel and select 2D Adaptive Clearing from the drop-down list. This will open the 2D Adaptive Clearing dialog box where you can define the parameters for an adaptive clearing operation.
13. In the 2D Adaptive Clearing dialog box, select Tool from the left pane. This will allow you to select or create a tool for your operation.
14. Click on the Select button and choose Flat End Mill from the Library tab. This will open the Flat End Mill dialog box where you can specify the dimensions and properties of your tool.
15. In the Flat End Mill dialog box, enter 10 mm for Diameter, 40 mm for Overall Length, 20 mm for Flute Length, and 4 for Number of Flutes. Click OK to close the Flat End Mill dialog box and save your tool.
16. Back in the 2D Adaptive Clearing dialog box, select Geometry from the left pane. This will allow you to select or create a boundary for your operation.
17. Click on the Select button and choose Silhouette from 8cf37b1e13
