## Step 2: Configure Communication Settings
 
To configure the communication settings between Citect 5.42l and DeviceXPlorer OPC Server, you need to define the following components:
 
- I/O Server: This is the computer that runs the OPC server and communicates with the devices.
- Board: This is the software driver that connects the I/O server to the OPC server.
- Port: This is the logical connection between the board and the OPC server.
- I/O Device: This is the logical representation of the device or system that provides data to the OPC server.

To define these components, follow these steps:

1. Select Communication from the project tree of Citect Explorer, and click I/O Server. Input an arbitrary name and comment, and click Addition button.
2. Click Board of project tree Communication in Citect Explorer, and input an arbitrary board name. After you confirm that Server Name is set as mentioned above, set OPC and 0 to Board Type and Address, and click Addition button.
3. Click Port of project tree Communication in Citect Explorer, and input an arbitrary port name. After you confirm that Server Name is set as mentioned above, select the board name, which is added as mentioned above, from the drop down list, and click Addition button.
4. Click I/O Device of project tree Communication in Citect Explorer, and input an arbitrary device name. After you select the port name that you added as mentioned above, set Takebishi.Dxp as an address and set OPC as a protocol, and click Addition button.

## Step 3: Define Variable Tags
 
To define variable tags, which are the data points that you want to monitor or control from Citect 5.42l, follow these steps:

1. Click Variable Tag of project tree Tag in Citect Explorer, and input an arbitrary tag name.
2. Select I/O device name that you added as mentioned above.
3. Set device name + "." + tag name, which is defined in OPC Server as address.

## Step 4: Setup Computer
 
To setup your computer to run Citect 5.42l on local computer, follow these steps:

1. Click Setting PC from Tool menu of Citect Explorer and start PC Setup Wizard.
2. Select Express Setup and click Next.
3. Select Server and Display Client of stand-alone PC and click Next.
4. Select project that you created from the drop down list.

## Step 5: Execute
 
To execute your project and start the communication with DeviceXPlorer OPC Server, follow these steps:

1. Compile your project from Build menu of Citect Explorer.
2. Run your project from Run menu of Citect Explorer.
