The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Safary and Kher, but criticized the script, direction and special effects. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 75% approval rating based on 4 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10[^3^]. Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times called the film "a light, fanciful touch and superior production design" with "more substance and cohesiveness than much Bollywood fare"[^4^]. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as "cheerful, silly and playful" and appreciated the child empowerment theme. However, Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a negative review, saying that it "doesn't make full use of its potential" and that it "lacks sparkle and fun". Koimoi also criticized the film for being "too simplistic and ordinary" and having a "sketchy plot" that even kids would not find plausible.
